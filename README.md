Homeworks related to Machine Learning

Homework #1:
For this homework, we implemented different variants of decision trees:
    1. Full Trees
    2. Full Trees using Gini Index
    3. Limiting depth decision trees

Homework #2:
For this homework, we experimented with the Perceptron algorithm and some variants on a data set:
    1. Simple perceptron
    2. Perceptron with decaying learning rate
    3. Averaged perceptron
    4. Margin Perceptron

Homework #3:
Homework #3 was multiple choice quiz based. It tested all the concepts taught until midterm.

Homework #4:
Homework #4 was entirely theory based. It covered PAC learnability, Shattering, and VC Dimension 

Homework #5:
Homework #5 is quiz based covering ensembles and boosting

Homework #6:
For this homework, we implemented and compared different learning strategies: SVM, logistic regression, and an ensemble that combines SVMs and decision trees

Final Project: 
The Old Bailey Proceedings have been digitized and made public for researchers. We have used this dataset to explore different classifiers that predict the outcome of trials and answer the following,
"Can we predict the decision of the court using transcribed dialogue during a trial?"
